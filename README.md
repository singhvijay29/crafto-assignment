# Crafto Assignment

This is a **Crafto Assignment** project built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework for building server-rendered applications. The project is designed to provide a seamless user experience for managing quotes, including functionalities for user login, quote creation, and viewing a list of quotes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in using a username and a one-time password (OTP).
- **Quote Management**: Users can create new quotes and view a list of existing quotes.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across various devices.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
